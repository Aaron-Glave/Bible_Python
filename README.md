# Bible_Python
Executable program to recommend Bible chapters.

It lets you pick between 1 of 2 random distributions:
1. Select a random book in the Bible, then a random chapter from that book.
    * Doing this, you have a 39/66 chance of reading from the Old Testament, and a 27/66 chance of reading from the New Testament.
2. Treat the bible as 1 huge book, and pick a random chapter of any book in the Bible.
   * Doing this, Psalms is the most likely Bible book to be selected (because Psalms is the longest book in the Bible and has the most chapters).
